		<h1> My information. </h1>
		I am 18 years old and studying game's development in new collage nottingham. I am a very tall guy with black ahir and mainly wear black clothing.

		I am a really big fan of gaming and game a lot when I am at home and also when I am at collage on my brakes and so on. The games I am most into are pokemon and RPG's such as skyrim. I have also recently completed making a 3D game in my cource and it has came together nicely.

		I am a huge animal lover and love all animals and When I move out into a flat or house i am going to be getting a huskie as they are my favorite breed of dog and most posiblly geting another snake.
